        Zeroth Generation: The initial computing machines from this generation
        were entirely mechanical. Early tools like the abacus, a calculating
        instrument of Babylonian origin, facilitated digital calculations. It
        utilized beads sliding along wires to represent decimal places, serving
        as a precursor to the modern digital calculator. Another innovation was
        the Pascaline, a calculator designed by French mathematician Blaise
        Pascal in the 17th century. Limited to addition and subtraction, it
        marked the first practical use of such a device.

        Stepped Reckoner and Difference Engine: The Stepped Reckoner, developed
        to perform various arithmetic operations, pioneered the concept of a
        moveable carriage for long multiplication and division. Charles
        Babbage's Difference Engine, designed in the 19th century, is considered
        an early calculating machine and the precursor to the first computer.
        While working on it, Babbage envisioned a more revolutionary device, the
        Analytical Engine, a general-purpose computing machine.

            events where a computer receives instructions and data during the
            input stage, processes them, saves information in the storage phase,
            and produces results in the output stage. This cycle is essential
            for a computer to perform useful work efficiently.
